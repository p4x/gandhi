    <h2>How Gandhi Works</h2>
    <p>Let's say you want to communicate securely and privately with a friend or trusted partner.</p>
    <p>First, find a trusted <i>Gandhi</i>-powered website, or alternatively, you could set one up yourself. Next, communicate via a secure channel which <i>Gandhi</i> server you are going to use. Share with your friend (ahead of time) the passphrase that you'd like to use. <small>(You could even tell your friend, "Check the NY Times each day. The passphrase will the be seventh word of the front-page article, the last word of the lead op-ed piece, and the predicted high temperature for Manhattan tomorrow.")</small></p>
    <p>Next, visit the agreed-upon <i>Gandhi</i> server using any web browser. Enter your message text and passphrase (where you can also specify message expiration and self-destruct settings as well).</p>
    <p>Anytime before your message is set to expire, your friend would then visit the same <i>Gandhi</i> server, type in the shared passphrase, and read your message.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><i>Gandhi, the App</i> is an open source Ruby on Rails application that allows multiple parties (one-to-one or one-to-many) to communicate securely and anonymously (for the most part, when configured as recommended). Of course, you should use your best judgememnt when using a <i>Gandhi</i> web app in the wild. <i>Gandhi, the App</i> is designed with multiple levels of message and passphrase encryption, but this means little if you do not trust the operator of a <i>Gandhi</i> server.</p>
    <p>Potential uses for <i>Gandhi, the App:</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>For whistleblowers and reporters to communicate securely</li>
      <li>For organizing a peaceful protest ("Meet at Tahrir square at 2pm")</li>
      <li>For Chinese dissidents (or dissidents of any stripe) to communicate freely without fear of reprisal</li>
      <li>For flirting with secret lovers</li>
      <li>For joking around with friends, without pesky chat log histories</li>
      <li> ... and sharing ASCII pictures of cats, of course.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p><i>Gandhi, the App</i> uses multiple layers of encryption and supports all languages based on UTF-8 (including braille!). More <i>Gandhi</i> features:
    <ul>
      <li>Passphrases are hashed using PBKDF2 (4096 default iterations) in the browser and are never sent over the wire as plaintext.</li>
      <li>Messages are encrypted first in the browser using AES 256-bit encryption, then sent to the server.</li>
      <li>The encrypted message is encrypted a second time on the server using AES-256.</li>
      <li>Ships with a builtin API (roll your own mobile client, command-line tool, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>Gandhi, the App</i> is powered by open source:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The app itself is released under the MIT License</li>
      <li>Built with Ruby on Rails (3.2.x), CryptoJS, OpenSSL, PostgreSQL, jQuery, and Twitter Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Crypto libraries used: PBKDF2, AES-256</li>
    </ul>
